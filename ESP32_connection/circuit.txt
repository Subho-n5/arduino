We will use a Arduino UNO to code the ESP_CAM-32 module as it has no micro-usb port. We can use FTDI programmer instead of Arduino UNO for the programming also.

ARDUINO UNO:
Connect Reset pin with GND pin (The second GND pin from the Reset pin)

ESP-CAM-32 :
Connect the GPIO pin 00 with GND next to it.
Connect the RX pin to the RX pin of Arduino UNO.
Connect the TX pin to the TX pin of Arduino UNO.
Connect the GND with the GND supply of Arduino UNO.
Connect the 5V with the 5V supply of Arduino UNO.
