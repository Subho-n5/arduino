SENSOR:
  connect the vcc of sensor with arduino 5v supply pin
  connect the gnd of sensor with arduino gnd pin
  connect the data pin of sensor with pin A0 of arduino
LED:
  connect gnd with the middle pin of the transistor
  connect the vcc of led with positive supply of 12v
TRANSISTOR: (TIP120, TIP122)
  Connect the left pin(BASE) with 1K resistance. From the resistance connect with pin 5 of arduino.
  Connect the middle pin(COLLECTOR) with the gnd of LED
  Connect the right pin(EMITTER) with the gnd of the 12V supply and gnd pin of arduino.
