The 4-way relay draws it's power from the arduino.
So, the Vcc of relay is connected to the 5V supply pin of arduino. And the ground is connected to a ground pin.
Now the 4 relay pin is connected to 4 digital pin of arduino.
RELAY -> DIGITAL PIN
  1   -> 4
  2   -> 6
  3   -> 8
  4   -> 10
  
After arduino & Relay connection. The relay is connected to the respective lights for control.
